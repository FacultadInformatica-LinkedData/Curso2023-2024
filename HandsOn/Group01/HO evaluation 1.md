    Analysis
    Ontology
        - The ontology does not follow the resource naming strategy defined in the analysis.
    RDF data
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - Verify that the class and property names used in the RDF data are the same as those used in the ontology.
        - Verify that classes and properties used in the RDF data are created in the ontology.
        - Not every string composed by numbers is a number.
        - Datatypes are missing.
        - Addresses are incorrectly represented. They have multiple numbers, latitudes and longitudes.
        - Some resources are used in object properties but are not declared as individuals.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
