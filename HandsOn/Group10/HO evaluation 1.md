    Analysis
        - The data analysis requires describing the data and the schema of the data. The suggestion is to use a table like in the slides. What you have included is the preprocessing of the data.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the resource naming strategy.
    Ontology
        - Do not mix labels in English and in Spanish in the terms that you create.
    RDF data
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy used by the ontology.
        - The rdfs:label property is not properly encoded.
        - There is no relationship of the resources of type Arbol with the rest of the graph.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
