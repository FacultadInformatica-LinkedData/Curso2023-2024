    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
    Ontology
        - The ontology presents serialization issues; is not a valid Turtle file.
        - The XML Schema datatypes are not correctly written.
    RDF data
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - Hashes in URIs must be placed just before the fragment identifier.
        - Minimise character encoding in URIs.
        - Not every string composed by numbers is a number.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
